//Describe the gameplay: two paddles reflect a ball trying to get it past the other paddle

//What are the conditions when the game begins?: paddle1, paddle2, score

//Does the game have an end? If so, what are the conditions for when it ends?: when a player gets to score 11

//What ifs will there be?: if the ball hits a paddle it is reflected if the ball hits the baoder it results in a point to the score

//What are the visual game components? For example, in Bouncing Box, the game components were the board and the box: the backround(black), the two paddles and the ball(white)

//Which will be static? (the board)

//Which will be animated? (the box)

//What data will you need to manage each game component? For example, in Bouncing Box, the data values were positionX, speedX, and points: postition1, position2, ballSpeed

//Events / Logic handlekeyDown, handlekeyUp

//What events will occur in this game? (timer events, keyboard events, clicking events?) keyboard events

//How do those events affect the data of the program?: the control the two paddles

//For each "event", write out the high-level logic of what will happen. It is better (and tricky) to be as specific as you can while remaining high-level: the arrow keys will control one paddle and the WASD keys will control the other
